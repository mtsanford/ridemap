<h2>How Routes are Calculated</h2>
<p>Route lines are genereated using Google's 'Get Directions' web service that computes the fastest route between two points.  If the generated route is not the route you intended, you can click on 'undo last point' to try again.  You may need to click more points, closer together, to get the route you desire.  There is a limit of 25 points. It may not be possible to create routes when clicking far from roads.  Due to the limitation of Google's 'Get Directions' web service, routes cannot be created in all countries.  If you create long routes, it is recommended that you do not use Internet Explorer version 6 or 7, but instead choose a browser such as Mozilla Firefox.</p>
